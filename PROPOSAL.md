# Project title:Data for Admission in the University.

**Author**: Venkata Rajasekhar. Dasari
**Date**: Date proposal was created on 11/16/2022 at 8pm.


## Motivation
This Project tells us about average scores, total number of students joined in the university and Probability of getting chance to be 
admitted.


## Investigative Questions
1. What are the average TOEFL and GRE score of all students in this university?
2. What is the probability of getting admission in the university based on average scores?
3. What is the average rating given by the students?

## Approach
Data that is maintained include student demographic data, academic test scores (TOEFL, GRE, etc.), grade point averages,
(GPAs) and all transcript information. One of the difficult task to handle the admission process for universities and the colleges
This project help the universities to given admissions based on average scores.

The dataset selected by me includes various information like GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, research and 
chance of admit. In this dataset, 400 entries are included.

In taken this data set from the  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/data-for-admission-in-the-university?resource=download.

# Collaborator of this project is "Akshay Dattatray Khare (Owner)"


## Expected Results 
The Expected Results of the taken data is we can find the averages of GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University ranking, CGPA, and chance of Admit
in the university.
* I did expected average GRE Score is 316.8075. 
* I did expected average TOEFL Score is 107.41.
* I did expected average of University ranking 3.0875.
* I did expected average  of CGPA 8.592985.
* I did expected average of chance of Admit 0.72459.

 
## New Python Packages or Modules
* Math module: We will use Math Module for Mathematics calculations for taken data to get expected results.
* Pandas: We will use Pandas to load csv files to python interpreter. From the resource 
https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+import+csv+files+into+python&oq=how+to+import+csv+files+&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0i512l9.92462j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8.
* We will find how to import csv files into python. I have taken information from this source
* We can use CSV module for loading CSV data into python to make calculations. Resources: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html

## Dataset Documentation
The main objective of this system is to have a wider reach and visibility of the university across the globe. The main 
focus lies on zero paperwork and centralizing the data. This will definitely boost speedy and on time process completion 
and reducing the manual effort for maintaining the heavy files. The data stored will more accurate, can be retrieved very
easily making the overall system highly responsive, efficient and flawless with no limit to physical boundaries.

Existing System:
Existing system is a total mess. It involves a lot of man power and also the process is very slow and generally suffers delays. 
No data securities as all records are maintained on papers which are prone to natural and physical damage. Only the local and 
the nearby students apply due to poor visibility of the University. Retrieving any past records is a very tedious and time- consuming 
process, and sometimes it may take 2-3 days.

Proposed System:
Data that is maintained include student demographic data, academic test scores (TOEFL, GRE, etc.), grade point averages,
(GPAs) and all transcript information. One of the difficult task to handle the admission process for universities and the colleges
This project help the universities to given admissions based on average scores. Many python packages and files are used for developing 
this project. It will gives the information about the average calculations on the test scores, based on CGPA's and the University rankings etc.

Expected Output:
It will gives the average values of Test Scores, CGPA's, University Ranking, and Chance of getting Admit.
